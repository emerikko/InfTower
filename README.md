# InfTower
Hey there! I'm excited to tell you about this console game! It's about a brave knight who's stuck on the top floor of an infinite tower with a strange shape. The goal of the game is to descend the tower, facing monsters, treasures, and other obstacles along the way.

Keep in mind that this game is still a *work in progress*, so some features like battles and walls in the levels are still being developed. Also world in this game is quite empty.

To start you should open main.py

_The game is programmed in Python 3.12._
